## Problem Statement

###### At  a time of natural disaster,what happens is the connectivity mostly internet connectivity in that region is lost.People are not able to connect with their near ones i.e people living nearby who might have been saved or themeselves found a new way of surviving and preventing themeselves from hazard.

## Solution Set

###### So our idea is to create an app that automatically senses the vibrations of the area using Machine Learning and will create a chat box in which people can connect to each other using **_peer-2-peer_** network using the technology of torrent in which one person sends the distress signal to another and the person sends it to another forming a chain in which everyone gets connected.Thus they can get _reconnected_  and find ways to save each other.
