## Problem Statement

###### At  a time of natural disaster,what happens is the connectivity mostly internet connectivity in that region is lost.People are not able to connect with their near ones i.e people living nearby who might have been saved or themeselves found a new way of surviving and preventing themeselves from hazard.This communication barrier is one of the most severe, yet _underlooked_ problem prior to any incident, which creates chaos and hustle at times of need

## Solution Set

###### So our idea is to create an app that automatically senses the vibrations of the area using Machine Learning and will create a chat box in which people can connect to each other using **_peer-2-peer_** network using the technology of torrent in which one person sends the distress signal to another and the person sends it to another forming a chain in which everyone gets connected.So basically a local network will be created in the target area, and many people will be connected with each other.The messages will be broadcasted and as a result all the connected people could view and assisst each other. Also we will add a feature to send the location of any person using gps location service through which help could be provided. .Thus they can get _reconnected_  and find ways to save each other.
